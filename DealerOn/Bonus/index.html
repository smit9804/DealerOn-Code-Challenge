                        <p>The one hundred and first meridian was passed.</p>
                        <p>
                            Mr.Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not
                            even the dummy-- complained of the length of the trip. Fix had
                            begun by winning several guineas, which he seemed likely to
                            lose; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than
                            Mr.Fogg. During the morning, chance distinctly favoured that
                            gentleman. Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of
                            playing a spade, when a voice behind him said, "I should play a
                            diamond."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel
                    Proctor.
                </p>
                <p>Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once.</p>
                <p>
                    "Ah! it's you, is it, Englishman?" cried the colonel; "it's you who
                    are going to play a spade!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "And who plays it," replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down the
                    ten of spades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds," replied Colonel Proctor,
                    in an insolent tone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been
                    played, adding, "You don't understand anything about whist."
